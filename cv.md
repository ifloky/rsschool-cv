## **About Myself:**

While studying at the university, I learned about web development, but did not attach much importance to this because I studied at the metallurgy. After graduating from the university, master's degree and having worked for a couple of years as an engineer at a metallurgical plant, I realized that "you can't cook porridge" here and began to study layout.

After half a year of studying HTML and CSS, I got a job as a webmaster in an online casino. While working in a casino, I began to master JS. To consolidate what I learned, I started taking the JavaScript/Front-end course from The Rolling Scopes community.

I am interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth,
in addition, there are a huge number of free quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
